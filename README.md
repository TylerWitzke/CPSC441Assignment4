/***Planet of the Jumping Bozons***/
This is a program used to simulate an Medium Access Control Protocol similar to that of an Aloha. To run the program first adjust the following constants to your prefered settings 
# of Bozon's (M)
Mean Sleep Duration (S)
Mean Yodel Duration (Y)
Length of the Simulation (END_TIME)
Then you may compile and run the programming using the following commands

g++ bozon.cpp -o bozon
./bozon

A summary of the performance will then appear, you may adjust the constants to test different enviorments for the 
simulator to run
